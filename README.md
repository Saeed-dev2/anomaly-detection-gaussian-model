# anomaly-detection-gaussian-model
Anomaly detection using Multivariate Gaussian distribution. This project implements a probabilistic model to identify outliers in multivariate data based on statistical thresholds. Evaluation is performed using cross-validation and F1 score metrics. Ideal for applications in fraud detection, sensor fault analysis, and rare event identification.
